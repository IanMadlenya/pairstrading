The source code for this pairs trading depends on data from eoddata.com. The data is imported into the MongoDB and then initialized from the main program: realTimePairs.py

The system creates optimized pairs based on what parameters (days MA, standard deviations,...) created profitable trades.

Of course with any trading system, use at your own risk.
